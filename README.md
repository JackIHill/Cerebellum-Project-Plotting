The cerebellum project studies cerebellar evolution at microscopic scale, across several primate species. It aims at creating precise delineations of the pial surface of the cerebellar cortex. With this, we measure the surface area and volume of each cerebellum and cerebrum in each primate brain. We will also attempt to use the annotations to generate 3D volumes and 3D meshes of the gorilla cerebellum. Eventually we will use these surface data to guide segmentation into cerebellar sub-structures with more precise functions.

Primarily, for annotation, we use MicroDraw, available at: https://microdraw.pasteur.fr/
